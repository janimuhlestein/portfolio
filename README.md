# Portfolio
A react-based personal portfolio

# Use case
Prospective employers (along with friends and family) might want to see what my portfolio consists of. This small react application will allow them to view the projects, along with a title, description, and github link. There is an about me section, a contact form, and a list of my links.

# Usage
While this could be downloaded from Github and run by npm install, I would suggest adding your own personal information, to make it much more interesting.

# Testing
Manual testing only, however, react-jest will be coming soon during the holidays.
